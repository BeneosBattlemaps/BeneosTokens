A balancing factor is that is is relatively easy to escape from within him as more creatures are swallowed, as the damage necessary to force a saving throw does not have to be dealt by a single creature on its turn - swallowed creatures have to deal 30 points of cumulative damage. They are however blinded and restrained, so its not <em style=\"border:0px;font-style:italic;font-variant:inherit;font-weight:inherit;font-stretch:inherit;font-size:inherit;line-height:inherit;font-family:inherit;vertical-align:baseline;margin:0px;padding:0px;box-sizing:border-box;-webkit-print-color-adjust:exact\">too</em> easy and keeping up to six creatures down his throat for another turn might be a Legendary Resistance well spent.</span></p><div class=\"blank\" style=\"border:0px;font:inherit;vertical-align:baseline;margin:0px;padding:0px;box-sizing:border-box;-webkit-print-color-adjust:exact;height:1em\"><p></p></div></li><li style=\"border:0px;font:inherit;vertical-align:baseline;margin:0px;padding:0px;box-sizing:border-box;-webkit-print-color-adjust:exact;break-inside:avoid\"><p style=\"border:0px;font-style:inherit;font-variant:inherit;font-weight:inherit;font-stretch:inherit;font-size:inherit;line-height:1.25em;font-family:inherit;vertical-align:baseline;margin:0px;padding:0px;box-sizing:border-box;-webkit-print-color-adjust:exact;overflow-wrap:break-word;display:block\"><span style=\"font-family:inherit\"><strong style=\"border:0px;font-style:inherit;font-variant:inherit;font-weight:bold;font-stretch:inherit;font-size:inherit;line-height:inherit;font-family:inherit;vertical-align:baseline;margin:0px;padding:0px;box-sizing:border-box;-webkit-print-color-adjust:exact;letter-spacing:-0.02em\">Talons</strong>: The Talons by themselves are nothing to write home about, but combined with either <strong style=\"border:0px;font-style:inherit;font-variant:inherit;font-weight:bold;font-stretch:inherit;font-size:inherit;line-height:inherit;font-family:inherit;vertical-align:baseline;margin:0px;padding:0px;box-sizing:border-box;-webkit-print-color-adjust:exact;letter-spacing:-0.02em\">Psychic Flaying</strong> or <strong style=\"border:0px;font-style:inherit;font-variant:inherit;font-weight:bold;font-stretch:inherit;font-size:inherit;line-height:inherit;font-family:inherit;vertical-align:baseline;margin:0px;padding:0px;box-sizing:border-box;-webkit-print-color-adjust:exact;letter-spacing:-0.02em\">Painful Presence</strong> these two Talon attacks per turn can be devastating.</span></p><div class=\"blank\" style=\"border:0px;font:inherit;vertical-align:baseline;margin:0px;padding:0px;box-sizing:border-box;-webkit-print-color-adjust:exact;height:1em\"><p></p></div></li><li style=\"border:0px;font:inherit;vertical-align:baseline;margin:0px;padding:0px;box-sizing:border-box;-webkit-print-color-adjust:exact;break-inside:avoid\"><p style=\"border:0px;font-style:inherit;font-variant:inherit;font-weight:inherit;font-stretch:inherit;font-size:inherit;line-height:1.25em;font-family:inherit;vertical-align:baseline;margin:0px;padding:0px;box-sizing:border-box;-webkit-print-color-adjust:exact;overflow-wrap:break-word;display:block\"><span style=\"font-family:inherit\"><strong style=\"border:0px;font-style:inherit;font-variant:inherit;font-weight:bold;font-stretch:inherit;font-size:inherit;line-height:inherit;font-family:inherit;vertical-align:baseline;margin:0px;padding:0px;box-sizing:border-box;-webkit-print-color-adjust:exact;letter-spacing:-0.02em\">Tail</strong>: Both Tail options add some versatility to Sharakhul’s moveset and aim to keep players on their toes. Grappling a creature with a <strong style=\"border:0px;font-style:inherit;font-variant:inherit;font-weight:bold;font-stretch:inherit;font-size:inherit;line-height:inherit;font-family:inherit;vertical-align:baseline;margin:0px;padding:0px;box-sizing:border-box;-webkit-print-color-adjust:exact;letter-spacing:-0.02em\">Slam</strong> attack can also serve the purpose of removing it from greater danger - if you want to keep the party’s healer safe from an impending <strong style=\"border:0px;font-style:inherit;font-variant:inherit;font-weight:bold;font-stretch:inherit;font-size:inherit;line-height:inherit;font-family:inherit;vertical-align:baseline;margin:0px;padding:0px;box-sizing:border-box;-webkit-print-color-adjust:exact;letter-spacing:-0.02em\">Psychic Flaying</strong> but don’t want to be too obvious about it, grapple it with the tail. It’s still a chunk of damage, but now the character is on the wrong end of the dragon to be hit by other stuff.</span></p><div class=\"blank\" style=\"border:0px;font:inherit;vertical-align:baseline;margin:0px;padding:0px;box-sizing:border-box;-webkit-print-color-adjust:exact;height:1em\"><p></p></div></li><li style=\"border:0px;font:inherit;vertical-align:baseline;margin:0px;padding:0px;box-sizing:border-box;-webkit-print-color-adjust:exact;break-inside:avoid\"><p style=\"border:0px;font-style:inherit;font-variant:inherit;font-weight:inherit;font-stretch:inherit;font-size:inherit;line-height:1.25em;font-family:inherit;vertical-align:baseline;margin:0px;padding:0px;box-sizing:border-box;-webkit-print-color-adjust:exact;overflow-wrap:break-word;display:block\"><span style=\"font-family:inherit\"><strong style=\"border:0px;font-style:inherit;font-variant:inherit;font-weight:bold;font-stretch:inherit;font-size:inherit;line-height:inherit;font-family:inherit;vertical-align:baseline;margin:0px;padding:0px;box-sizing:border-box;-webkit-print-color-adjust:exact;letter-spacing:-0.02em\">Painful Presence</strong>: Usually Dragons have some kind of fear effect, but not Sharakhul. This is another of his most deadly features and can set the stage for a devastating barrage of Legendary Actions. A <strong style=\"border:0px;font-style:inherit;font-variant:inherit;font-weight:bold;font-stretch:inherit;font-size:inherit;line-height:inherit;font-family:inherit;vertical-align:baseline;margin:0px;padding:0px;box-sizing:border-box;-webkit-print-color-adjust:exact;letter-spacing:-0.02em\">Painful Presence</strong> followed by a series of <strong style=\"border:0px;font-style:inherit;font-variant:inherit;font-weight:bold;font-stretch:inherit;font-size:inherit;line-height:inherit;font-family:inherit;vertical-align:baseline;margin:0px;padding:0px;box-sizing:border-box;-webkit-print-color-adjust:exact;letter-spacing:-0.02em\">Tail (Gore</strong>) Legendary Actions can put a dent in almost everything. It’s also a great way to boost the efficiency of otherwise neglectable minions, as even less powerful attacks hurt when they deal double damage.</span></p><div class=\"blank\" style=\"border:0px;font:inherit;vertical-align:baseline;margin:0px;padding:0px;box-sizing:border-box;-webkit-print-color-adjust:exact;height:1em\"><p></p></div></li><li style=\"border:0px;font:inherit;vertical-align:baseline;margin:0px;padding:0px;box-sizing:border-box;-webkit-print-color-adjust:exact;break-inside:avoid\"><p style=\"border:0px;font-style:inherit;font-variant:inherit;font-weight:inherit;font-stretch:inherit;font-size:inherit;line-height:1.25em;font-family:inherit;vertical-align:baseline;margin:0px;padding:0px;box-sizing:border-box;-webkit-print-color-adjust:exact;overflow-wrap:break-word;display:block\"><span style=\"font-family:inherit\"><strong style=\"border:0px;font-style:inherit;font-variant:inherit;font-weight:bold;font-stretch:inherit;font-size:inherit;line-height:inherit;font-family:inherit;vertical-align:baseline;margin:0px;padding:0px;box-sizing:border-box;-webkit-print-color-adjust:exact;letter-spacing:-0.02em\">Psychic Flaying</strong>: Instead of a breath weapon, Sharakhul has his Psychic Flaying action. Now this deals less damage than an ancient dragon’s breath, but, again, being vulnerable to <em style=\"border:0px;font-style:italic;font-variant:inherit;font-weight:inherit;font-stretch:inherit;font-size:inherit;line-height:inherit;font-family:inherit;vertical-align:baseline;margin:0px;padding:0px;box-sizing:border-box;-webkit-print-color-adjust:exact\">all</em> damage types is a big deal.

However, a high level party should have access to a greater restoration or heal effect, but its a great way to force some resource spending. This ability can straight up remove a character from combat and can also be used as a signal to your players to get the hell out of there and return with more knowledge and prep time. It is limited to two uses per day though and will probably fail to achieve anything if you put too much hope into it.</span></p><div class=\"blank\" style=\"border:0px;font:inherit;vertical-align:baseline;margin:0px;padding:0px;box-sizing:border-box;-webkit-print-color-adjust:exact;height:1em\"><p></p></div></li><li style=\"border:0px;font:inherit;vertical-align:baseline;margin:0px;padding:0px;box-sizing:border-box;-webkit-print-color-adjust:exact;break-inside:avoid\"><p style=\"border:0px;font-style:inherit;font-variant:inherit;font-weight:inherit;font-stretch:inherit;font-size:inherit;line-height:1.25em;font-family:inherit;vertical-align:baseline;margin:0px;padding:0px;box-sizing:border-box;-webkit-print-color-adjust:exact;overflow-wrap:break-word;display:block\"><span style=\"font-family:inherit\"><strong style=\"border:0px;font-style:inherit;font-variant:inherit;font-weight:bold;font-stretch:inherit;font-size:inherit;line-height:inherit;font-family:inherit;vertical-align:baseline;margin:0px;padding:0px;box-sizing:border-box;-webkit-print-color-adjust:exact;letter-spacing:-0.02em\">Skinless Shroud</strong>: If compared to our regular dragon, the reaction section lacks some damage and mobility options. But Sharakhul has enough going on and he is a bit on the frail side and can only half some damage and not negate it outright. His tattered wings also cause him to be not as swift as his healthier brethren, so he has no means of disenganging per reaction, bonus action or legendary action. But given that a melee attack can douse you in tainted dragon blood, maybe it is better to let him get out of melee range unscathed.</span></p><div class=\"blank\" style=\"border:0px;font:inherit;vertical-align:baseline;margin:0px;padding:0px;box-sizing:border-box;-webkit-print-color-adjust:exact;height:1em\"><p></p></div></li><li style=\"border:0px;font:inherit;vertical-align:baseline;margin:0px;padding:0px;box-sizing:border-box;-webkit-print-color-adjust:exact;break-inside:avoid\"><p style=\"border:0px;font-style:inherit;font-variant:inherit;font-weight:inherit;font-stretch:inherit;font-size:inherit;line-height:1.25em;font-family:inherit;vertical-align:baseline;margin:0px;padding:0px;box-sizing:border-box;-webkit-print-color-adjust:exact;overflow-wrap:break-word;display:block\"><span style=\"font-family:inherit\"><strong style=\"border:0px;font-style:inherit;font-variant:inherit;font-weight:bold;font-stretch:inherit;font-size:inherit;line-height:inherit;font-family:inherit;vertical-align:baseline;margin:0px;padding:0px;box-sizing:border-box;-webkit-print-color-adjust:exact;letter-spacing:-0.02em\">Legendary Actions</strong>: Sharakhul can take three legendary actions per round, one allows him to make some additional attacks and two give the Red Kin something to do, applying either the grappled or frightened condition.</span></p></li></ul><h3 id=\"4-conclusion\" style=\"border-top:0px;border-right:0px;border-bottom:2px solid var(--HB_Color_HeaderUnderline);border-left:0px;border-image:initial;font-style:inherit;font-variant:inherit;font-weight:800;font-stretch:inherit;font-size:0.575cm;line-height:0.995em;font-family:MrEavesRemake;vertical-align:baseline;margin:0.155cm 0px 0px;padding:0px;box-sizing:border-box;-webkit-print-color-adjust:exact;color:var(--HB_Color_HeaderText)\"><span style=\"font-family:MrEavesRemake\"><strong>4.

Sharakhul’s modus operandi is to overwhelm his enemies, tearing into them while shrieking continously and then use their panic to pick them off one by one. You should try the same - keep him on the offensive and should he get cornered, use one of his abilities to sow fear and regain the upper hand. Don’t pick fights with characters that have ways to mitigate his insane damage output or use his lack of mobility against him, always try to force the players to react and adapt to his next horrible ability.</span></p></div></div>","public":""},"alignment":"Chaotic Evil","race":"","type":{"value":"dragon","subtype":"","swarm":"","custom":""},"environment":"","cr":20,"spellLevel":0,"source":"Beneos Tokens"},"traits":{"size":"grg","di":{"value":[],"bypasses":[],"custom":""},"dr":{"value":[],"bypasses":[],"custom":""},"dv":{"value":[],"bypasses":[],"custom":""},"ci":{"value":[],"custom":""},"languages":{"value":["abyssal","common","deep","draconic","undercommon"],"custom":"Telepathy 60 ft."}},"currency":{"pp":0,"gp":0,"ep":0,"sp":0,"cp":0},"skills":{"acr":{"value":0,"ability":"dex","bonuses":{"check":"","passive":""}},"ani":{"value":0,"ability":"wis","bonuses":{"check":"","passive":""}},"arc":{"value":0,"ability":"int","bonuses":{"check":"","passive":""}},"ath":{"value":0,"ability":"str","bonuses":{"check":"","passive":""}},"dec":{"value":0,"ability":"cha","bonuses":{"check":"","passive":""}},"his":{"value":0,"ability":"int","bonuses":{"check":"","passive":""}},"ins":{"value":0,"ability":"wis","bonuses":{"check":"","passive":""}},"itm":{"value":0,"ability":"cha","bonuses":{"check":"","passive":""}},"inv":{"value":0,"ability":"int","bonuses":{"check":"","passive":""}},"med":{"value":0,"ability":"wis","bonuses":{"check":"","passive":""}},"nat":{"value":0,"ability":"int","bonuses":{"check":"","passive":""}},"prc":{"value":1,"ability":"wis","bonuses":{"check":"","passive":""}},"prf":{"value":0,"ability":"cha","bonuses":{"check":"","passive":""}},"per":{"value":0,"ability":"cha","bonuses":{"check":"","passive":""}},"rel":{"value":0,"ability":"int","bonuses":{"check":"","passive":""}},"slt":{"value":0,"ability":"dex","bonuses":{"check":"","passive":""}},"ste":{"value":1,"ability":"dex","bonuses":{"check":"","passive":""}},"sur":{"value":0,"ability":"wis","bonuses":{"check":"","passive":""}}},"spells":{"spell1":{"value":0,"override":null},"spell2":{"value":0,"override":null},"spell3":{"value":0,"override":null},"spell4":{"value":0,"override":null},"spell5":{"value":0,"override":null},"spell6":{"value":0,"override":null},"spell7":{"value":0,"override":null},"spell8":{"value":0,"override":null},"spell9":{"value":0,"override":null},"pact":{"value":0,"override":null}},"bonuses":{"mwak":{"attack":"","damage":""},"rwak":{"attack":"","damage":""},"msak":{"attack":"","damage":""},"rsak":{"attack":"","damage":""},"abilities":{"check":"","save":"","skill":""},"spell":{"dc":""}},"resources":{"legact":{"value":3,"max":3},"legres":{"value":3,"max":3},"lair":{"value":true,"initiative":20}}},"prototypeToken":{"flags":{},"name":"Sharakhul","displayName":20,"width":4,"height":4,"lockRotation":false,"rotation":0,"actorLink":false,"disposition":-1,"displayBars":20,"bar1":{"attribute":"attributes.hp"},"bar2":{"attribute":"attributes.ac.value"},"randomImg":false,"alpha":1,"light":{"dim":0,"bright":0,"angle":360,"color":null,"alpha":1,"animation":{"speed":5,"intensity":5,"type":null,"reverse":false},"coloration":1,"attenuation":0.5,"luminosity":0.5,"saturation":0,"contrast":0,"shadows":0,"darkness":{"min":0,"max":1}},"texture":{"src":"beneos_tokens_assets/080_sharakhul/top/080_sharakhul-idle_1_top.webm","tint":null,"scaleX":1,"scaleY":1,"offsetX":0,"offsetY":0,"rotation":0},"sight":{"angle":360,"enabled":true,"range":60,"brightness":0,"visionMode":"darkvision","color":null,"attenuation":0,"saturation":-1,"contrast":0},"detectionModes":[]},"_stats":{"systemId":"dnd5e","systemVersion":"2.1.5","coreVersion":"10.291","createdTime":1667904380962,"modifiedTime":1684699341058,"lastModifiedBy":"aiycoH7UFhTW8VJy"},"ownership":{"default":0,"aiycoH7UFhTW8VJy":3},"folder":null,"sort":0,"_id":"3SruLGnPoTtRxmGB"}

Its predatorial nature stems from its ability to regenerate, locate the players and attack again and again, until the players find a permanent way to dispose of it (in which case it will return after 24 hours) or it going nuclear, making for a sudden spike in difficulty. The Megarach lends itself to a patient playstyle, tracking the players and biding its time for the next attack, before unleashing its crocodilian ferocity upon them.</p><div><p></p></div></li><li><p><strong>Purpose: Hunter and Pressure.</strong> As a hunter, the Magarach excels at focusing on a single target, using a combination of its different actions to deal vast amounts of damage to it. The Magarach can lock its targets in combat, a place where even sturdy characters with high amounts of hit points won’t last too long, especially if this is not the first time they fight (Relentless Pursuer). The challenges posed by the Magarach are twofold, as it is a tough opponent to overcome in the first place and because it returning from both grievous injury and death can turn a longer stay within its domain into a war of attrition. The players are pressured into figuring out a way to eliminate the Magarach quickly each time. If they do, the clock starts ticking, as the Magarach will return stronger, having faced the players before.</p><p></p></li><li><strong>Challenge.</strong> A single Magarach stalking a dungeon can be a thematic reoccuring encounter and a challenging combat szenario for both lower level and medium level parties. A single Megarach will be no match for a high level party, but their reincarnation-based skillset can be applied to increase the challenge of the overall dungeon, instead of single encounters. As such, it can act both as a low level boss, as its diverse moveset and combination of passive and active abilities and actions makes for an interesting back and forth, where players are hard pressed to overcome the various mechanics of the Megarach. For a higher level party, leaning into the Megarach reappearing and a series of skirmishes culminating in the Burden of a Thousand Lifes can make for an interesting secondary plot thread with a satisfying payoff.</li></ul><h2><strong>Story Prompts.</strong></h2><p><strong>Undying Pursuer.</strong> On their path through a labyrinthian temple, the players hear the heavy footfalls of an unknown pursuer.

Eager to inflict wrath and violence upon the world, they are often called upon by Diabolists and Summoners to enact violence in their service. As they are lesser devils, representing the aspect of a sin, rather than holding command over it, they are less likely tointentionallytry and corrupt their temporary master.</p><p></p><h1>Showcase: Gatebreaker Devil</h1><div><p></p></div><h3><strong>Fighting Style and Purpose.</strong></h3><ul><li><p><strong>Fighting Style: Melee and Charge.</strong> Fighting the Gatebreaker Devil should feel like fighting a burning train. It barrels into the midst of its enemies, preferably via Infernal Onslaught to set the mood, then tempts the players with its Wrathful Pact mechanic as they respond in kind, only to pummel them with Gore and Smash attacks in melee or puts further pressure on them by releasing the Ragefire Breath.</p><div><p></p></div></li><li><p><strong>Purpose: Damage and Gimmick.</strong> The Gatebreaker Devil primarily deals damage, but most of its offensive abilities also have a caveat that provides additional interactions. The Wrathful Pact feature adds an additional layer, blending a narrative element (the tempting guile of a devil) with a mechanical element (reroll attacks, take damage and suffer the consequences).</p><div><p></p></div></li><li><p><strong>Challenge.</strong> An encounter featuring the Gatebreaker Devil needs to uphold a certain drive and energy to keep the players under pressure due to the onslaught of fire and fists. Once they catch their breath the Devil can quickly fall apart, as it has no condition immunities and easily folds under effects targeting INT, WIS or CHA. However, those able to pump out a lot of these effects targeting those stats can quickly fold under the Devil’s damage output in return. All in all, the Devil makes for a high pressure encounter on its own or a beefy, attention-demanding summon to act as the muscle for an otherwise more cerebral and magic-focused fight against a high level caster or even another devil.</p></li></ul><div><p></p></div><div><p></p></div><h3><strong>Story Prompts.</strong></h3><div><p></p></div><p><strong>Fires of Wrath.</strong> Summoned by a spurned applicant to the Mage’s Guild, a Gatebreaker Devil rages through the streets, burning down homes and causing an ever-escalating upheaval due to its infectious wrath.</p><div><p></p></div><p><strong>Trust No One.</strong> The beloved local sovereign suddenly exhibits a cruel streak and previously unthinkable outbursts of rage and wrath. Unbeknownst to even his closest advisors, the sceptre gifted by a rival-turned ally holds the essence of a Gatebreaker Devil, corrupting the lords spirit and heralding an infernal incursion.</p><div><p></p></div><h3><strong>Loot</strong></h3><div><p></p></div><h4><strong>Wrathfire Talisman</strong></h4><p><em><strong>Magical trinket, rare, requires attunement</strong></em></p><p></p><p><em>A bloodstained gold trinket with a piece of igneous rock at its heart, emitting heat and an ember glow.</em></p><p></p><p>Once per day, you can use a bonus action to submit to a violent rage that grants you immunity to the frightened and charmed condition, as well as resistance to physical and fire damage. As long as you are raging, your melee weapon attacks deal an additional 1d6 fire damage and you must use your movement on your turn to move towards a creature and use your action and a bonus action granted by this rage to make melee attacks against it.

Offensively</strong></h3><p></p><div><ul><li><p>Although the Aberrant Tyrant seems complicated due to the vast amounts of different Eye Beams, it is really quite simple to run, as you can’t really plan around the different Beams, because they are determined randomly. You can however adapt your tactics by choosing the target for each beam.</p><div><p></p></div></li><li><p>With the Tyrant’s Beams, you get a variety of Dexterity, Constitution and Wisdom saves. Depending on how Intelligent or battle-savy your Tyrant is, it might have figured out the party’s weaknesses after a few beams. This lets you start to apply some tactics - roll for the beam, than choose the most effective target.</p><div><p></p></div></li><li><p>With Enervation, Disintegration and Death Beam there are only three beams that actually deal damage (which is intended, as discussed below). Enervation is the only one, where a even a successful saving throw results in half damage. While the Tyrant’s other beam effects are undoubtedly powerful, an unlucky combination of beams against a resilient party might enable them to quickly outdamage the Tyrant. The trick is to set up the battlefield in a way that each beam can be utilized in an effective way and no beam feels like a fluke.</p><div><p></p></div></li><li><p>To expand on that with an example: The Telekinetic Beam becomes vastly more dangerous if there are terrain featurs within the Tyrant’s lair that interact with the beam. Hanging cages slamming shut when the Tyrant telekinetically moves a creature into them, pits with minor monsters in them to throw a player into or open fires to just dangle a mouthy barbarian over, slowly roasting them. The Telekinetic Beam can also lift an object up to 300 pounds, which might still include a smaller or more nimble petrified party member. Nothing like having your petrified gnome bard flung at you!</p><div><p></p></div></li><li><p>It is also really funny to use Telekinesis to move a sleeping creature that got hit by the aptly named Sleep Beam out of reach for the rest of the party, rendering them unable to wake the creature or force them to really commit to waking them up. Enjoy your nap!</p><p></p></li><li><p>The threat of Disintegration should loom large. A player petrified by the, again accurately named, Petrifying Beam becomes an object and Large or smaller objects automatically get disintegrated. You can consider a magically petrified player as a magical object to keep the Tyrant from dusting your party, but otherwise it is a neat party trick.</p><div><p></p></div></li><li><p>Be careful not to overcompensate with traps or minions for a perceived lack of damaging Beam options - the anti-magic cone is arguably the Tyrant’s greatest weapon, as most healing is magical, be it spells or potions. Safe for a few mechanics that allow to non-magical self heal, there aren’t many ways to reliably heal other characters without magic. Keep your cone focused on characters with low hit points and you will have your players praying for anything but the disintegration or death beams, so it all works out in the end.</p><div><p></p></div></li><li><p>Overcharge Null Field can be devastating trump card towards the end of an encounter, when the players have probably spent most of their low level spells and saved their higher level spell slots for the right moment. Destroying something like two fourth level spell slots for 8d8 damage and robbing the character of the opportunity to use them will absolutely sting and it can get so much worse than that. </p><div><p></p></div></li></ul><h3><strong>2. Defensively.</strong></h3><ul><li><p>Defensively the Tyrant almost completely relies on its Null Field. It has no legendary resistances or interesting defensive capabilities otherwise, except for solid saving throw proficiencies. It is paramount to get the most out of the largest cone you’ll probably ever use and keep those pesky magic users in line.</p><div><p></p></div></li><li><p>With only 180 hit points, the Tyrant is quite squishy. Being as paranoid as they are, it would not be unreasonable to take some kind of defensive measures to mitigate this weakness. Maybe a floating and rotund construct crafted in the likeness of the Tyrant, capable of taking half damage for the Tyrant and firing less powerful versions of some of the eye beams? Call it an Eye Guardian perhaps and watch the disgusted expression on your players face. Could be fun!</p></li></ul></div><div><div><ul><li><p>If you want to keep your friends, you could just let the Tyrant become slowly aware of the different kinds of danger the individual characters pose and have it act accordingly. Use your floating to stay out of reach of powerful melee characters or fling them away using Telekinesis (the utility beam, you will be so happy each time you roll it up!).</p><div><p></p></div></li><li><p>In all seriousness - quickly identify the biggest dangers for the Tyrant’s quickly dwindling hit points and prioritise dealing with them.</p><div><p></p></div></li><li><p>Try and Charm Beam the party’s cleric, maybe you can convince them to heal you.</p></li></ul><h3><strong>3. General Notes</strong></h3><div><p></p></div><ul><li><p>As always, don’t run your big boss monster on its own. It should have minions with them that harry your party, so rangers and rogues can’t just comfortably sit back and snipe. Thats just one factor, but it tends to come up a lot. If your magic users are to powerful, thats on your creatures. Keep ‘em busy fighting for their life and you won’t have to worry about them raining death upon your delicately crafted enemies. A boss’s minions should mitigate some weaknesses of the boss, so that removing them feels like an actual step towards defeating the boss, rather than them just clogging up the battlefield and makes for a multi-phase fight without getting to complicated with the set up of the fight.</p><div><p></p></div></li><li><p>Aberrant Tyrants are certifiably insane, so make sure to use the opportunity to get ham and utilize your wildest dreams of lair construction. Floating spheres of lava? Check. The whole lair dressed as a bee hive with giant bees patrolling its tunnels and the Tyrant themselves styled as a bee queen, painted back and yellow with a little crown on top? Check. You can get away with everything an unhined Aberration might dream into existence.</p><div><p></p></div></li><li><p>The Null Field is the Tyrants bread and butter. It can be tricky to get the most of it, that is why we included the nice little gotcha in form of the Realign legendary action. This can really turn a round of combat for the worse, as the players will have to work towards getting around the cone to heal or, well, use magic. Just shrugging and turning a bit to get them back into view can be really, really annoyingly powerful</p></li></ul></div></div>","public":""},"alignment":"Lawful Evil","race":"","type":{"value":"aberration","subtype":"","swarm":"","custom":""},"environment":"","cr":14,"spellLevel":0,"source":"Beneos Tokens"},"traits":{"size":"lg","di":{"value":[],"bypasses":[],"custom":""},"dr":{"value":[],"bypasses":[],"custom":""},"dv":{"value":[],"bypasses":[],"custom":""},"ci":{"value":["prone"],"custom":""},"languages":{"value":["deep","undercommon"],"custom":""}},"currency":{"pp":0,"gp":0,"ep":0,"sp":0,"cp":0},"skills":{"acr":{"value":0,"ability":"dex","bonuses":{"check":"","passive":""}},"ani":{"value":0,"ability":"wis","bonuses":{"check":"","passive":""}},"arc":{"value":0,"ability":"int","bonuses":{"check":"","passive":""}},"ath":{"value":0,"ability":"str","bonuses":{"check":"","passive":""}},"dec":{"value":0,"ability":"cha","bonuses":{"check":"","passive":""}},"his":{"value":0,"ability":"int","bonuses":{"check":"","passive":""}},"ins":{"value":0,"ability":"wis","bonuses":{"check":"","passive":""}},"itm":{"value":0,"ability":"cha","bonuses":{"check":"","passive":""}},"inv":{"value":0,"ability":"int","bonuses":{"check":"","passive":""}},"med":{"value":0,"ability":"wis","bonuses":{"check":"","passive":""}},"nat":{"value":0,"ability":"int","bonuses":{"check":"","passive":""}},"prc":{"value":2,"ability":"wis","bonuses":{"check":"","passive":""}},"prf":{"value":0,"ability":"cha","bonuses":{"check":"","passive":""}},"per":{"value":0,"ability":"cha","bonuses":{"check":"","passive":""}},"rel":{"value":0,"ability":"int","bonuses":{"check":"","passive":""}},"slt":{"value":0,"ability":"dex","bonuses":{"check":"","passive":""}},"ste":{"value":0,"ability":"dex","bonuses":{"check":"","passive":""}},"sur":{"value":0,"ability":"wis","bonuses":{"check":"","passive":""}}},"spells":{"spell1":{"value":0,"override":null},"spell2":{"value":0,"override":null},"spell3":{"value":0,"override":null},"spell4":{"value":0,"override":null},"spell5":{"value":0,"override":null},"spell6":{"value":0,"override":null},"spell7":{"value":0,"override":null},"spell8":{"value":0,"override":null},"spell9":{"value":0,"override":null},"pact":{"value":0,"override":null}},"bonuses":{"mwak":{"attack":"","damage":""},"rwak":{"attack":"","damage":""},"msak":{"attack":"","damage":""},"rsak":{"attack":"","damage":""},"abilities":{"check":"","save":"","skill":""},"spell":{"dc":""}},"resources":{"legact":{"value":3,"max":3},"legres":{"value":0,"max":0},"lair":{"value":true,"initiative":0}}},"prototypeToken":{"flags":{},"name":"Aberrant Tyrant","displayName":20,"width":2,"height":2,"lockRotation":false,"rotation":0,"actorLink":false,"disposition":-1,"displayBars":20,"bar1":{"attribute":"attributes.hp"},"bar2":{"attribute":"attributes.ac.value"},"randomImg":false,"alpha":1,"light":{"dim":0,"bright":0,"angle":360,"color":null,"alpha":1,"animation":{"speed":5,"intensity":5,"type":null,"reverse":false},"coloration":1,"attenuation":0.5,"luminosity":0.5,"saturation":0,"contrast":0,"shadows":0,"darkness":{"min":0,"max":1}},"texture":{"src":"beneos_tokens_assets/085_aberrant_tyrant_4/top/085_aberrant_tyrant_4-idle_1_top.webm","tint":null,"scaleX":1,"scaleY":1,"offsetX":0,"offsetY":0,"rotation":0},"sight":{"angle":360,"enabled":true,"range":120,"brightness":0,"visionMode":"darkvision","color":null,"attenuation":0,"saturation":-1,"contrast":0},"detectionModes":[]},"_stats":{"systemId":"dnd5e","systemVersion":"2.1.5","coreVersion":"10.291","createdTime":1669973655892,"modifiedTime":1684699341972,"lastModifiedBy":"aiycoH7UFhTW8VJy"},"ownership":{"default":0,"aiycoH7UFhTW8VJy":3},"folder":null,"sort":0,"_id":"9gi5fPhK6DY75SGm"}

Getting close to it sucks, as you risk 2d8 (<strong>Necrovoltaic Generator</strong>) + 2d10 (<strong>Cursed Curcuit</strong>) + 3d6 (<strong>Necrovoltaic Grasp</strong>) lightning damage each time you get into its face. The first creature getting too close should get absolutely grilled to intimidate the players and make them think twice about getting into its grill again. This is kind of a bluff, because the Reanimator may die to a stiff breeze.</p><div><p></p></div></li><li><p>The aforementioned <strong>Necrovoltaic Beam </strong>and<strong> Voltgheist Barrage</strong> are the big hitters, and with a bit of grasping going on (<strong>Necrovoltaic Grasp</strong> for the additional chance to recharge), especially the <strong>Beam</strong> can be fired more often than your players might prefer.</p><div><p></p></div></li><li><p>If you support your Reanimator with <strong>Circuitslaves</strong> (which you absolutely should), each of its offensive abilites is also a great way to power them up with temporary hit points and <strong>Overcharge</strong> them - try to line your Circuitslaves up and hit them with a <strong>Necrovoltaic Beam</strong> for a devastating <strong>Necrovolative Burn-Out</strong>, as their explosion deals additional damage equal to their temporary hit points.</p></li></ul><div><p></p></div><h3><strong>2. Defensively.</strong></h3><ul><li><p>There is not that much to say about its defense. Be sure to obliterate sources of spike damage early and with extreme prejudice and pray that your <strong>Circuitslaves</strong> (other other supporting creatures) can keep the party occupied long enough to get some damage in.</p><div><p></p></div></li><li><p><strong>Lifeleech Protocol</strong> is a last hurrah, after which the Reanimator eager to live another day should at least attempt to get away.

Supported by a host of Circuitslaves and aided by some lucky/unlucky rolls, an encounter with a Reanimator is able to nuke a party - especially the combination of <strong>Necrovoltaic Beam, Necrovoltaic Overcharge </strong>and<strong> Necrovolatile Burn-Out</strong> can wreak havoc on a groups defenses, as the Circuitslaves gain temp hit points equal to the lightning damage they receive and dish this damage right back out when exploding.

Weakened enemies have less hit points, increasing the effectiveness of the Spores. It’s also the Mimic’s only real way of escaping, as it has only 15 ft. of movement. However, if you ambush an already weakened party the Spores are a great starting move.

Their lair is permeated by unnatural coldness, icy mists cover the floor and no flame can stand against ever-howling winds. The fey magic of the Wintergrim twists this place, mirror images and warped reflections appearing on ice surfaces, threatening and taunting intruders, luring them deeper into the frozen core of the lair. Wintergrim delight in abducting creatures they consider weak and letting them roam freely through their labyrinthian homesteads, as they pose no threat to the fey and will soon succumb to the freezing temperatures and cutting winds, unable to find their way out of the fey-touched ice labyrinths. At the height of a Wintergrim’s reign of terror, its lair is littered with the dead and dying, partially frozen to the ground or walls, partially torn open by other captives’ desperate attempts to harvest another’s warmth for themself.</p><p></p><h2><strong>Lair Actions</strong></h2><p>On initiative count 20 (losing initiative ties), the Wintergrim takes a lair action to cause one of the following effects; the Wintergrim can’t use the same effect two rounds in a row:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Curse the Anathema.</strong> Non-magical metal objects within 100 ft. of the Wintergrim get infused with the Wintergrim’s hate and give off intense frost, dealing 9 (2d8) cold damage to each creature touching a metal object.</p><div><p></p></div></li><li><p><strong>Glacial Mists.</strong> Magical icy fog spreads from a point the Wintergrim chooses within 40 feet of it, filling a 15-foot-radius sphere until the fey dismisses it as an action, uses this lair action again, or dies. The fog spreads around corners. The space is heavily obscured, a creature with darkvision can’t see through this magical fog and nonmagical light can’t pierce it.</p></li></ul><p></p><ul><li><p><strong>Mirrorhaunt Labyrinth.</strong> Three glacial monoliths materialize at points of the Wintergrim’s choosing within 80 ft. of it from the misty floor, exuding intense cold. These monoliths are huge objects (AC 17, 40 hit points, immune to psychic, poison and cold damage) and are eligible targets for the Wintergrim’s Mirrorhaunt ability and creatures starting their turn within 10 ft. of the monolith or moving within 10 ft. of them for the first time during their turn must succeed on a DC 16 Constitution saving throw or have their movement speed reduced to 0 until the start of their next turn. They last until the Wintergrim dismiss them as an action, uses this lair action again, dies or until they are destroyed.</p><div><p></p></div></li></ul><h2><strong>Regional Effects</strong></h2><p>The region containing a Wintergrim’s lair is warped by the Wintergrim’s fey magic, which creates one or more of the following effects:</p><p></p><ul><li><p>Within 20 miles of the lair, heavy snow storms are blocking out the sun and the temperature drops signifcantly with every mile travelled towards the lair. Fires must be tended to constantly and only give the faintest impression of warmth, keeping one alive but doing nothing to make them feel better.</p><p></p></li><li><p>Within 10 miles of the lair, nature appears frozen in time, with thick snow or ice covering every inch. No birds can be heard and animals are gaunt and haggard, often too weak to attack or even flee. Sunlight feels like a distant memory.</p><div><p></p></div></li><li><p>Within 1 mile of the lair, the cold becomes almost unbearable, it is impossible to start non-magical fires and water freezes within its containers. Harsh winds cut into exposed skin like invisible knives, sleeping in the open without a magical source of heat invites certain death. The feeling of warmth feels all but forgotten.</p></li></ul><p></p><h2><strong>Fighting Style and Purpose</strong></h2><ul><li><p><strong>Fighting Style: Demanding and Lethal</strong>. A Wintergrim forces a party to roll a lot of saving throws to resist its various abilites, making this a demanding encounter. As they target Strength and Constitution, the Wintergrim is much more dangerous to characters with already lower hit points. This is also what makes it actually lethal - the lower a character’s hit points, the more dangerous the Wintergrim’s Smothering Snowfall becomes. With the Wintergrim being intelligent enough to determine the most viable targets, its speed offered by the Mirrorhaunt and Dashing through the Snow abilites and the spiraling dynamic of Winter’s Embrace and Smothering Snowfall, an encounter with the Wintergrim can easily end up killing one or several player characters.</p><div><p></p></div></li><li><p><strong>Purpose: Gimmick, Pressure and Boss.</strong> The Wintergrim relies on the gimmicky nature of its abilities, but figuring those out does not end the encounter, as with many gimmick type enemies. This is where the pressure nature of the Wintergrim comes, there are several layers of abilities providing unique challenges the players need to overcome before getting the upper hand of the fight. Due to the complexity and danger posed by an encounter with the Wintergrim, it is best use as a boss. Running the Wintergrim deserves a narrative setup for maximum impact and requires more preparation to run than a simple encounter.</p></li></ul><p></p><ul><li><strong>Challenge.</strong> As always, the actual challenge a creature poses is hard to quantify, when the actual danger comes from abilities, rather than just values like AC, hit points and damage. The Wintergrim’s danger lies in its abilites and versatility. Its innate aura ability, the Smothering Snowfall, is a lethal threat and increases in power over the course of the encounter, making even a weakened Wintergrim extremely dangerous. The challenge lies in forcing it to attack targets that can best withstand the fey’s set of abilities, hardy characters with high Strength, Constitution and lots of hit points to resist the sleeping effect. If however the Wintergrim manages to overcome these hard targets, and it has the means to do so (or can simply try and ignore them), frail characters are in danger. A well planned encounter within the Wintergrim’s lair does not require additional minions, as the interactive set of abilities and layered challenge can make for a dynamic encounter by themselves.</li></ul>","public":""},"alignment":"","race":"","type":{"value":"fey","subtype":"","swarm":"","custom":""},"environment":"","cr":12,"spellLevel":0,"source":"Beneos Tokens"},"traits":{"size":"lg","di":{"value":["bludgeoning","cold","piercing","slashing"],"bypasses":["mgc"],"custom":""},"dr":{"value":["fire"],"bypasses":[],"custom":""},"dv":{"value":[],"bypasses":[],"custom":""},"ci":{"value":["charmed","exhaustion"],"custom":""},"languages":{"value":["sylvan"],"custom":""}},"currency":{"pp":0,"gp":0,"ep":0,"sp":0,"cp":0},"skills":{"acr":{"value":0,"ability":"dex","bonuses":{"check":"","passive":""}},"ani":{"value":0,"ability":"wis","bonuses":{"check":"","passive":""}},"arc":{"value":0,"ability":"int","bonuses":{"check":"","passive":""}},"ath":{"value":0,"ability":"str","bonuses":{"check":"","passive":""}},"dec":{"value":0,"ability":"cha","bonuses":{"check":"","passive":""}},"his":{"value":0,"ability":"int","bonuses":{"check":"","passive":""}},"ins":{"value":0,"ability":"wis","bonuses":{"check":"","passive":""}},"itm":{"value":0,"ability":"cha","bonuses":{"check":"","passive":""}},"inv":{"value":0,"ability":"int","bonuses":{"check":"","passive":""}},"med":{"value":0,"ability":"wis","bonuses":{"check":"","passive":""}},"nat":{"value":0,"ability":"int","bonuses":{"check":"","passive":""}},"prc":{"value":1,"ability":"wis","bonuses":{"check":"","passive":""}},"prf":{"value":0,"ability":"cha","bonuses":{"check":"","passive":""}},"per":{"value":0,"ability":"cha","bonuses":{"check":"","passive":""}},"rel":{"value":0,"ability":"int","bonuses":{"check":"","passive":""}},"slt":{"value":0,"ability":"dex","bonuses":{"check":"","passive":""}},"ste":{"value":1,"ability":"dex","bonuses":{"check":"","passive":""}},"sur":{"value":0,"ability":"wis","bonuses":{"check":"","passive":""}}},"spells":{"spell1":{"value":0,"override":null},"spell2":{"value":0,"override":null},"spell3":{"value":0,"override":null},"spell4":{"value":0,"override":null},"spell5":{"value":0,"override":null},"spell6":{"value":0,"override":null},"spell7":{"value":0,"override":null},"spell8":{"value":0,"override":null},"spell9":{"value":0,"override":null},"pact":{"value":0,"override":null}},"bonuses":{"mwak":{"attack":"","damage":""},"rwak":{"attack":"","damage":""},"msak":{"attack":"","damage":""},"rsak":{"attack":"","damage":""},"abilities":{"check":"","save":"","skill":""},"spell":{"dc":""}},"resources":{"legact":{"value":2,"max":2},"legres":{"value":1,"max":1},"lair":{"value":true,"initiative":3}}},"prototypeToken":{"flags":{},"name":"Wintergrim","displayName":20,"width":2,"height":2,"lockRotation":false,"rotation":0,"actorLink":false,"disposition":-1,"displayBars":20,"bar1":{"attribute":"attributes.hp"},"bar2":{"attribute":"attributes.ac.value"},"randomImg":false,"alpha":1,"light":{"dim":20,"bright":null,"angle":360,"color":"#a3f0eb","alpha":0.1,"animation":{"speed":5,"intensity":5,"type":"fog","reverse":false},"coloration":1,"attenuation":0.5,"luminosity":0.5,"saturation":0,"contrast":0,"shadows":0,"darkness":{"min":0,"max":1}},"texture":{"src":"beneos_tokens_assets/087_wintergrim/top/087_wintergrim-idle_1_top.webm","tint":null,"scaleX":1,"scaleY":1,"offsetX":0,"offsetY":0,"rotation":0},"sight":{"angle":360,"enabled":true,"range":60,"brightness":1,"visionMode":"basic","color":null,"attenuation":0.1,"saturation":0,"contrast":0},"detectionModes":[]},"_stats":{"systemId":"dnd5e","systemVersion":"2.1.5","coreVersion":"10.291","createdTime":1671189071708,"modifiedTime":1684699342176,"lastModifiedBy":"aiycoH7UFhTW8VJy"},"ownership":{"default":0,"aiycoH7UFhTW8VJy":3},"folder":null,"sort":0,"_id":"TVR72HmFKBTlRzPs"}

Of course, you can mitigate this factor a bit by giving the players some information on what to expect from the Hydra, so they can try and prepare for its devastating venom. Also, there are quite a lot of features granting resistance to poison, a high level party might not suffer from this feature as much as others.

It is paramount that you keep some kind of tally during the fight, several at best. The first thing to continously note and update is the amount of heads in play. The second tally should be the amount of heads destroyed. Each destroyed head increases the Constitution saving throw necessary to replace heads by 1. With a starting DC of 10 and a +9 bonus to Con saving throws, it starts out almost impossible to fail. But as the Hydra loses heads at an increased pace, this DC rises. The Hydra will make its saves most of the time and it will probably be dead (or have killed the party) before the DC reaches dwindling heights. But it adds a factor of randomness to the whole shebang, and this is also the place were the fabled weakness to fire comes in. It <em style=\"border:0px;font-style:italic;font-variant:inherit;font-weight:inherit;font-stretch:inherit;font-size:inherit;line-height:inherit;font-family:inherit;vertical-align:baseline;margin:0px;padding:0px;box-sizing:border-box;-webkit-print-color-adjust:exact\">also</em> gives the players an agenda in finding a way to manipulate the Hydra’s ability to pass its saves or suppress its regeneration.</span></p><div class=\"blank\" style=\"border:0px;font:inherit;vertical-align:baseline;margin:0px;padding:0px;box-sizing:border-box;-webkit-print-color-adjust:exact;height:1em\"><p></p></div></li><li style=\"border:0px;font:inherit;vertical-align:baseline;margin:0px;padding:0px;box-sizing:border-box;-webkit-print-color-adjust:exact;break-inside:avoid\"><p style=\"border:0px;font-style:inherit;font-variant:inherit;font-weight:inherit;font-stretch:inherit;font-size:inherit;line-height:1.25em;font-family:inherit;vertical-align:baseline;margin:0px;padding:0px;box-sizing:border-box;-webkit-print-color-adjust:exact;overflow-wrap:break-word;display:block\"><span style=\"font-family:inherit\">Despite its disgusting name (sorry for that), <strong style=\"border:0px;font-style:inherit;font-variant:inherit;font-weight:bold;font-stretch:inherit;font-size:inherit;line-height:inherit;font-family:inherit;vertical-align:baseline;margin:0px;padding:0px;box-sizing:border-box;-webkit-print-color-adjust:exact;letter-spacing:-0.02em\">Moistening Mucus</strong> is the Hydra’s attempt to somewhat mitigate its glaring weakness. The Hydra blatantly ignores the first 20 points of fire damage, after that its done. If you want to buff the Hydra even furhter, you could give it a Legendary Action to produce an amount of Mucus or have it automatically gain 5 Mucus points with each new head.

It is a creature ripped straight from horror stories told around campfires since the dawn of man, whose blood-curdling screams reverberated from cave walls, as huddled creatures prayed for a sunrise that would not save them. Its ability to walk on walls via Spider Climb makes it an extremely mobile and versatile hunter that strikes to greatest effect when it gets the drop on its prey. At first it should not try to focus on one player, but rather create an opportunity where vulnerable members of a party can be reached. The combination of Feasting On Fear and the Scything Claws’ bleed effect, paired with the combat prowess of the Spawn all but guarantees it’s regenerative ability to kick in with minimal set up.</p><div><p></p></div><p>The spawn should attack and withdraw before the party gets to mount a coordinated defense - once the Spawn is cornered by close-combat fighters with high AC and hit points, while getting bombarded with spells or arrows from a distance it’s over. It may get some good hits in, but the general oppressive and threatening atmosphere of the encounter will be gone. Both the Blood-Freezing Howl and the Bite are handy tools to prevent the players from ganging up on the Spawn.

Offensively</strong></h3><p></p><div><ul><li><p>Although the Aberrant Tyrant seems complicated due to the vast amounts of different Eye Beams, it is really quite simple to run, as you can’t really plan around the different Beams, because they are determined randomly. You can however adapt your tactics by choosing the target for each beam.</p><div><p></p></div></li><li><p>With the Tyrant’s Beams, you get a variety of Dexterity, Constitution and Wisdom saves. Depending on how Intelligent or battle-savy your Tyrant is, it might have figured out the party’s weaknesses after a few beams. This lets you start to apply some tactics - roll for the beam, than choose the most effective target.</p><div><p></p></div></li><li><p>With Enervation, Disintegration and Death Beam there are only three beams that actually deal damage (which is intended, as discussed below). Enervation is the only one, where a even a successful saving throw results in half damage. While the Tyrant’s other beam effects are undoubtedly powerful, an unlucky combination of beams against a resilient party might enable them to quickly outdamage the Tyrant. The trick is to set up the battlefield in a way that each beam can be utilized in an effective way and no beam feels like a fluke.</p><div><p></p></div></li><li><p>To expand on that with an example: The Telekinetic Beam becomes vastly more dangerous if there are terrain featurs within the Tyrant’s lair that interact with the beam. Hanging cages slamming shut when the Tyrant telekinetically moves a creature into them, pits with minor monsters in them to throw a player into or open fires to just dangle a mouthy barbarian over, slowly roasting them. The Telekinetic Beam can also lift an object up to 300 pounds, which might still include a smaller or more nimble petrified party member. Nothing like having your petrified gnome bard flung at you!</p><div><p></p></div></li><li><p>It is also really funny to use Telekinesis to move a sleeping creature that got hit by the aptly named Sleep Beam out of reach for the rest of the party, rendering them unable to wake the creature or force them to really commit to waking them up. Enjoy your nap!</p><p></p></li><li><p>The threat of Disintegration should loom large. A player petrified by the, again accurately named, Petrifying Beam becomes an object and Large or smaller objects automatically get disintegrated. You can consider a magically petrified player as a magical object to keep the Tyrant from dusting your party, but otherwise it is a neat party trick.</p><div><p></p></div></li><li><p>Be careful not to overcompensate with traps or minions for a perceived lack of damaging Beam options - the anti-magic cone is arguably the Tyrant’s greatest weapon, as most healing is magical, be it spells or potions. Safe for a few mechanics that allow to non-magical self heal, there aren’t many ways to reliably heal other characters without magic. Keep your cone focused on characters with low hit points and you will have your players praying for anything but the disintegration or death beams, so it all works out in the end.</p><div><p></p></div></li><li><p>Overcharge Null Field can be devastating trump card towards the end of an encounter, when the players have probably spent most of their low level spells and saved their higher level spell slots for the right moment. Destroying something like two fourth level spell slots for 8d8 damage and robbing the character of the opportunity to use them will absolutely sting and it can get so much worse than that. </p><div><p></p></div></li></ul><h3><strong>2. Defensively.</strong></h3><ul><li><p>Defensively the Tyrant almost completely relies on its Null Field. It has no legendary resistances or interesting defensive capabilities otherwise, except for solid saving throw proficiencies. It is paramount to get the most out of the largest cone you’ll probably ever use and keep those pesky magic users in line.</p><div><p></p></div></li><li><p>With only 180 hit points, the Tyrant is quite squishy. Being as paranoid as they are, it would not be unreasonable to take some kind of defensive measures to mitigate this weakness. Maybe a floating and rotund construct crafted in the likeness of the Tyrant, capable of taking half damage for the Tyrant and firing less powerful versions of some of the eye beams? Call it an Eye Guardian perhaps and watch the disgusted expression on your players face. Could be fun!</p></li></ul></div><div><div><ul><li><p>If you want to keep your friends, you could just let the Tyrant become slowly aware of the different kinds of danger the individual characters pose and have it act accordingly. Use your floating to stay out of reach of powerful melee characters or fling them away using Telekinesis (the utility beam, you will be so happy each time you roll it up!).</p><div><p></p></div></li><li><p>In all seriousness - quickly identify the biggest dangers for the Tyrant’s quickly dwindling hit points and prioritise dealing with them.</p><div><p></p></div></li><li><p>Try and Charm Beam the party’s cleric, maybe you can convince them to heal you.</p></li></ul><h3><strong>3. General Notes</strong></h3><div><p></p></div><ul><li><p>As always, don’t run your big boss monster on its own. It should have minions with them that harry your party, so rangers and rogues can’t just comfortably sit back and snipe. Thats just one factor, but it tends to come up a lot. If your magic users are to powerful, thats on your creatures. Keep ‘em busy fighting for their life and you won’t have to worry about them raining death upon your delicately crafted enemies. A boss’s minions should mitigate some weaknesses of the boss, so that removing them feels like an actual step towards defeating the boss, rather than them just clogging up the battlefield and makes for a multi-phase fight without getting to complicated with the set up of the fight.</p><div><p></p></div></li><li><p>Aberrant Tyrants are certifiably insane, so make sure to use the opportunity to get ham and utilize your wildest dreams of lair construction. Floating spheres of lava? Check. The whole lair dressed as a bee hive with giant bees patrolling its tunnels and the Tyrant themselves styled as a bee queen, painted back and yellow with a little crown on top? Check. You can get away with everything an unhined Aberration might dream into existence.</p><div><p></p></div></li><li><p>The Null Field is the Tyrants bread and butter. It can be tricky to get the most of it, that is why we included the nice little gotcha in form of the Realign legendary action. This can really turn a round of combat for the worse, as the players will have to work towards getting around the cone to heal or, well, use magic. Just shrugging and turning a bit to get them back into view can be really, really annoyingly powerful</p></li></ul></div></div>","public":""},"alignment":"Lawful Evil","race":"","type":{"value":"aberration","subtype":"","swarm":"","custom":""},"environment":"","cr":14,"spellLevel":0,"source":"Beneos Tokens"},"traits":{"size":"lg","di":{"value":[],"bypasses":[],"custom":""},"dr":{"value":[],"bypasses":[],"custom":""},"dv":{"value":[],"bypasses":[],"custom":""},"ci":{"value":["prone"],"custom":""},"languages":{"value":["deep","undercommon"],"custom":""}},"currency":{"pp":0,"gp":0,"ep":0,"sp":0,"cp":0},"skills":{"acr":{"value":0,"ability":"dex","bonuses":{"check":"","passive":""}},"ani":{"value":0,"ability":"wis","bonuses":{"check":"","passive":""}},"arc":{"value":0,"ability":"int","bonuses":{"check":"","passive":""}},"ath":{"value":0,"ability":"str","bonuses":{"check":"","passive":""}},"dec":{"value":0,"ability":"cha","bonuses":{"check":"","passive":""}},"his":{"value":0,"ability":"int","bonuses":{"check":"","passive":""}},"ins":{"value":0,"ability":"wis","bonuses":{"check":"","passive":""}},"itm":{"value":0,"ability":"cha","bonuses":{"check":"","passive":""}},"inv":{"value":0,"ability":"int","bonuses":{"check":"","passive":""}},"med":{"value":0,"ability":"wis","bonuses":{"check":"","passive":""}},"nat":{"value":0,"ability":"int","bonuses":{"check":"","passive":""}},"prc":{"value":2,"ability":"wis","bonuses":{"check":"","passive":""}},"prf":{"value":0,"ability":"cha","bonuses":{"check":"","passive":""}},"per":{"value":0,"ability":"cha","bonuses":{"check":"","passive":""}},"rel":{"value":0,"ability":"int","bonuses":{"check":"","passive":""}},"slt":{"value":0,"ability":"dex","bonuses":{"check":"","passive":""}},"ste":{"value":0,"ability":"dex","bonuses":{"check":"","passive":""}},"sur":{"value":0,"ability":"wis","bonuses":{"check":"","passive":""}}},"spells":{"spell1":{"value":0,"override":null},"spell2":{"value":0,"override":null},"spell3":{"value":0,"override":null},"spell4":{"value":0,"override":null},"spell5":{"value":0,"override":null},"spell6":{"value":0,"override":null},"spell7":{"value":0,"override":null},"spell8":{"value":0,"override":null},"spell9":{"value":0,"override":null},"pact":{"value":0,"override":null}},"bonuses":{"mwak":{"attack":"","damage":""},"rwak":{"attack":"","damage":""},"msak":{"attack":"","damage":""},"rsak":{"attack":"","damage":""},"abilities":{"check":"","save":"","skill":""},"spell":{"dc":""}},"resources":{"legact":{"value":3,"max":3},"legres":{"value":0,"max":0},"lair":{"value":true,"initiative":0}}},"prototypeToken":{"flags":{},"name":"Aberrant Tyrant","displayName":20,"width":2,"height":2,"lockRotation":false,"rotation":0,"actorLink":false,"disposition":-1,"displayBars":20,"bar1":{"attribute":"attributes.hp"},"bar2":{"attribute":"attributes.ac.value"},"randomImg":false,"alpha":1,"light":{"dim":0,"bright":0,"angle":360,"color":null,"alpha":1,"animation":{"speed":5,"intensity":5,"type":null,"reverse":false},"coloration":1,"attenuation":0.5,"luminosity":0.5,"saturation":0,"contrast":0,"shadows":0,"darkness":{"min":0,"max":1}},"texture":{"src":"beneos_tokens_assets/085_aberrant_tyrant_3/top/085_aberrant_tyrant_3-idle_1_top.webm","tint":null,"scaleX":1,"scaleY":1,"offsetX":0,"offsetY":0,"rotation":0},"sight":{"angle":360,"enabled":true,"range":120,"brightness":0,"visionMode":"darkvision","color":null,"attenuation":0,"saturation":-1,"contrast":0},"detectionModes":[]},"_stats":{"systemId":"dnd5e","systemVersion":"2.1.5","coreVersion":"10.291","createdTime":1669973655892,"modifiedTime":1684699341799,"lastModifiedBy":"aiycoH7UFhTW8VJy"},"ownership":{"default":0,"aiycoH7UFhTW8VJy":3},"folder":null,"sort":0,"_id":"kmG8tALl0n6ZHlZj"}

With an AC of 22, a damage threshold, magic resistances and several damage and condition immunities, it excels at just not taking damage, solidifying its fighting style as that of a tank. It also wants to engange opponents in close combat, going so far as to magically pull them closer to get them in range of its Arbiter’s Fists.</p><div><p></p></div></li><li><p><strong>Purpose: Anti Caster and Gimmick.</strong> The Swordbearer Reliquary has nearly insurmountable defenses against magic users, being hard to hit with spell attacks, immune to plenty of conditions and generally taking only half damage from spells and magical effects. With its Old Grudge’s ability, it can quickly single out and punish a caster, pulling the target towards it and pummeling the restrained creature into the ground. This also plays into the Swordbearers gimmick, the challenge posed to martial characters to take measure of their worth and task them to overcome the layered martial challenges posed by it - both the passive ones (high AC and damage threshold, magic resistance, high damage output) and the active ones (Trial of Martial Virtue, Effigy of the War-God).</p></li></ul><div><p></p><h3><strong>Challenge.</strong></h3></div><div><p></p></div><ul><li><strong>Challenge.</strong> Fighting a Swordbearer Reliquary forces the casters to take a step back and let the melee characters do the heavy lifting. It is a trial of martial prowess, each successful attack will be rewarded, each miss will be punished. Within the area of the trial, the Swordbearer itself benefits from the additional damage dice and can quickly deal vast amounts of damage. The players need to balance their offense and defense, denying the Swordbearer the cumulative advantages of hitting them, while continuously dealing damage to the construct. A secondary challenge is to immobilize and weaken the Reliquary by pulling the blades free, proving valor and martial might in the process.</li></ul>","public":""},"alignment":"Lawful Neutral","race":"","type":{"value":"construct","subtype":"","swarm":"","custom":""},"environment":"","cr":9,"spellLevel":0,"source":"Beneos Tokens"},"traits":{"size":"huge","di":{"value":["poison","psychic"],"bypasses":[],"custom":"Piercing, Slashing and Bludgeoning damage from non-martial weapons"},"dr":{"value":[],"bypasses":[],"custom":""},"dv":{"value":[],"bypasses":[],"custom":""},"ci":{"value":["charmed","exhaustion","frightened","petrified","poisoned"],"custom":""},"languages":{"value":[],"custom":""}},"currency":{"pp":0,"gp":0,"ep":0,"sp":0,"cp":0},"skills":{"acr":{"value":0,"ability":"dex","bonuses":{"check":"","passive":""}},"ani":{"value":0,"ability":"wis","bonuses":{"check":"","passive":""}},"arc":{"value":0,"ability":"int","bonuses":{"check":"","passive":""}},"ath":{"value":1,"ability":"str","bonuses":{"check":"","passive":""}},"dec":{"value":0,"ability":"cha","bonuses":{"check":"","passive":""}},"his":{"value":0,"ability":"int","bonuses":{"check":"","passive":""}},"ins":{"value":0,"ability":"wis","bonuses":{"check":"","passive":""}},"itm":{"value":0,"ability":"cha","bonuses":{"check":"","passive":""}},"inv":{"value":0,"ability":"int","bonuses":{"check":"","passive":""}},"med":{"value":0,"ability":"wis","bonuses":{"check":"","passive":""}},"nat":{"value":0,"ability":"int","bonuses":{"check":"","passive":""}},"prc":{"value":0,"ability":"wis","bonuses":{"check":"","passive":""}},"prf":{"value":0,"ability":"cha","bonuses":{"check":"","passive":""}},"per":{"value":0,"ability":"cha","bonuses":{"check":"","passive":""}},"rel":{"value":0,"ability":"int","bonuses":{"check":"","passive":""}},"slt":{"value":0,"ability":"dex","bonuses":{"check":"","passive":""}},"ste":{"value":0,"ability":"dex","bonuses":{"check":"","passive":""}},"sur":{"value":0,"ability":"wis","bonuses":{"check":"","passive":""}}},"spells":{"spell1":{"value":0,"override":null},"spell2":{"value":0,"override":null},"spell3":{"value":0,"override":null},"spell4":{"value":0,"override":null},"spell5":{"value":0,"override":null},"spell6":{"value":0,"override":null},"spell7":{"value":0,"override":null},"spell8":{"value":0,"override":null},"spell9":{"value":0,"override":null},"pact":{"value":0,"override":null}},"bonuses":{"mwak":{"attack":"","damage":""},"rwak":{"attack":"","damage":""},"msak":{"attack":"","damage":""},"rsak":{"attack":"","damage":""},"abilities":{"check":"","save":"","skill":""},"spell":{"dc":""}},"resources":{"legact":{"value":0,"max":0},"legres":{"value":0,"max":0},"lair":{"value":false,"initiative":0}}},"prototypeToken":{"flags":{},"name":"Swordbearer Reliquary","displayName":20,"width":3,"height":3,"lockRotation":false,"rotation":0,"actorLink":false,"disposition":-1,"displayBars":20,"bar1":{"attribute":"attributes.hp"},"bar2":{"attribute":"attributes.ac.value"},"randomImg":false,"alpha":1,"light":{"dim":0,"bright":0,"angle":360,"color":null,"alpha":1,"animation":{"speed":5,"intensity":5,"type":null,"reverse":false},"coloration":1,"attenuation":0.5,"luminosity":0.5,"saturation":0,"contrast":0,"shadows":0,"darkness":{"min":0,"max":1}},"texture":{"src":"beneos_tokens_assets/090_swordbearer_reliquary/top/090_swordbearer_reliquary-idle_1_top.webm","tint":null,"scaleX":1,"scaleY":1,"offsetX":0,"offsetY":0,"rotation":0},"sight":{"angle":360,"enabled":true,"range":60,"brightness":1,"visionMode":"basic","color":null,"attenuation":0.1,"saturation":0,"contrast":0},"detectionModes":[]},"_stats":{"systemId":"dnd5e","systemVersion":"2.1.5","coreVersion":"10.291","createdTime":1684699342473,"modifiedTime":1684699342473,"lastModifiedBy":"aiycoH7UFhTW8VJy"},"ownership":{"default":0,"aiycoH7UFhTW8VJy":3},"folder":null,"sort":0,"_id":"nrHBf69oyTlwVpSW"}

Offensively</strong></h3><p></p><div><ul><li><p>Although the Aberrant Tyrant seems complicated due to the vast amounts of different Eye Beams, it is really quite simple to run, as you can’t really plan around the different Beams, because they are determined randomly. You can however adapt your tactics by choosing the target for each beam.</p><div><p></p></div></li><li><p>With the Tyrant’s Beams, you get a variety of Dexterity, Constitution and Wisdom saves. Depending on how Intelligent or battle-savy your Tyrant is, it might have figured out the party’s weaknesses after a few beams. This lets you start to apply some tactics - roll for the beam, than choose the most effective target.</p><div><p></p></div></li><li><p>With Enervation, Disintegration and Death Beam there are only three beams that actually deal damage (which is intended, as discussed below). Enervation is the only one, where a even a successful saving throw results in half damage. While the Tyrant’s other beam effects are undoubtedly powerful, an unlucky combination of beams against a resilient party might enable them to quickly outdamage the Tyrant. The trick is to set up the battlefield in a way that each beam can be utilized in an effective way and no beam feels like a fluke.</p><div><p></p></div></li><li><p>To expand on that with an example: The Telekinetic Beam becomes vastly more dangerous if there are terrain featurs within the Tyrant’s lair that interact with the beam. Hanging cages slamming shut when the Tyrant telekinetically moves a creature into them, pits with minor monsters in them to throw a player into or open fires to just dangle a mouthy barbarian over, slowly roasting them. The Telekinetic Beam can also lift an object up to 300 pounds, which might still include a smaller or more nimble petrified party member. Nothing like having your petrified gnome bard flung at you!</p><div><p></p></div></li><li><p>It is also really funny to use Telekinesis to move a sleeping creature that got hit by the aptly named Sleep Beam out of reach for the rest of the party, rendering them unable to wake the creature or force them to really commit to waking them up. Enjoy your nap!</p><p></p></li><li><p>The threat of Disintegration should loom large. A player petrified by the, again accurately named, Petrifying Beam becomes an object and Large or smaller objects automatically get disintegrated. You can consider a magically petrified player as a magical object to keep the Tyrant from dusting your party, but otherwise it is a neat party trick.</p><div><p></p></div></li><li><p>Be careful not to overcompensate with traps or minions for a perceived lack of damaging Beam options - the anti-magic cone is arguably the Tyrant’s greatest weapon, as most healing is magical, be it spells or potions. Safe for a few mechanics that allow to non-magical self heal, there aren’t many ways to reliably heal other characters without magic. Keep your cone focused on characters with low hit points and you will have your players praying for anything but the disintegration or death beams, so it all works out in the end.</p><div><p></p></div></li><li><p>Overcharge Null Field can be devastating trump card towards the end of an encounter, when the players have probably spent most of their low level spells and saved their higher level spell slots for the right moment. Destroying something like two fourth level spell slots for 8d8 damage and robbing the character of the opportunity to use them will absolutely sting and it can get so much worse than that. </p><div><p></p></div></li></ul><h3><strong>2. Defensively.</strong></h3><ul><li><p>Defensively the Tyrant almost completely relies on its Null Field. It has no legendary resistances or interesting defensive capabilities otherwise, except for solid saving throw proficiencies. It is paramount to get the most out of the largest cone you’ll probably ever use and keep those pesky magic users in line.</p><div><p></p></div></li><li><p>With only 180 hit points, the Tyrant is quite squishy. Being as paranoid as they are, it would not be unreasonable to take some kind of defensive measures to mitigate this weakness. Maybe a floating and rotund construct crafted in the likeness of the Tyrant, capable of taking half damage for the Tyrant and firing less powerful versions of some of the eye beams? Call it an Eye Guardian perhaps and watch the disgusted expression on your players face. Could be fun!</p></li></ul></div><div><div><ul><li><p>If you want to keep your friends, you could just let the Tyrant become slowly aware of the different kinds of danger the individual characters pose and have it act accordingly. Use your floating to stay out of reach of powerful melee characters or fling them away using Telekinesis (the utility beam, you will be so happy each time you roll it up!).</p><div><p></p></div></li><li><p>In all seriousness - quickly identify the biggest dangers for the Tyrant’s quickly dwindling hit points and prioritise dealing with them.</p><div><p></p></div></li><li><p>Try and Charm Beam the party’s cleric, maybe you can convince them to heal you.</p></li></ul><h3><strong>3. General Notes</strong></h3><div><p></p></div><ul><li><p>As always, don’t run your big boss monster on its own. It should have minions with them that harry your party, so rangers and rogues can’t just comfortably sit back and snipe. Thats just one factor, but it tends to come up a lot. If your magic users are to powerful, thats on your creatures. Keep ‘em busy fighting for their life and you won’t have to worry about them raining death upon your delicately crafted enemies. A boss’s minions should mitigate some weaknesses of the boss, so that removing them feels like an actual step towards defeating the boss, rather than them just clogging up the battlefield and makes for a multi-phase fight without getting to complicated with the set up of the fight.</p><div><p></p></div></li><li><p>Aberrant Tyrants are certifiably insane, so make sure to use the opportunity to get ham and utilize your wildest dreams of lair construction. Floating spheres of lava? Check. The whole lair dressed as a bee hive with giant bees patrolling its tunnels and the Tyrant themselves styled as a bee queen, painted back and yellow with a little crown on top? Check. You can get away with everything an unhined Aberration might dream into existence.</p><div><p></p></div></li><li><p>The Null Field is the Tyrants bread and butter. It can be tricky to get the most of it, that is why we included the nice little gotcha in form of the Realign legendary action. This can really turn a round of combat for the worse, as the players will have to work towards getting around the cone to heal or, well, use magic. Just shrugging and turning a bit to get them back into view can be really, really annoyingly powerful</p></li></ul></div></div>","public":""},"alignment":"Lawful Evil","race":"","type":{"value":"aberration","subtype":"","swarm":"","custom":""},"environment":"","cr":14,"spellLevel":0,"source":"Beneos Tokens"},"traits":{"size":"lg","di":{"value":[],"bypasses":[],"custom":""},"dr":{"value":[],"bypasses":[],"custom":""},"dv":{"value":[],"bypasses":[],"custom":""},"ci":{"value":["prone"],"custom":""},"languages":{"value":["deep","undercommon"],"custom":""}},"currency":{"pp":0,"gp":0,"ep":0,"sp":0,"cp":0},"skills":{"acr":{"value":0,"ability":"dex","bonuses":{"check":"","passive":""}},"ani":{"value":0,"ability":"wis","bonuses":{"check":"","passive":""}},"arc":{"value":0,"ability":"int","bonuses":{"check":"","passive":""}},"ath":{"value":0,"ability":"str","bonuses":{"check":"","passive":""}},"dec":{"value":0,"ability":"cha","bonuses":{"check":"","passive":""}},"his":{"value":0,"ability":"int","bonuses":{"check":"","passive":""}},"ins":{"value":0,"ability":"wis","bonuses":{"check":"","passive":""}},"itm":{"value":0,"ability":"cha","bonuses":{"check":"","passive":""}},"inv":{"value":0,"ability":"int","bonuses":{"check":"","passive":""}},"med":{"value":0,"ability":"wis","bonuses":{"check":"","passive":""}},"nat":{"value":0,"ability":"int","bonuses":{"check":"","passive":""}},"prc":{"value":2,"ability":"wis","bonuses":{"check":"","passive":""}},"prf":{"value":0,"ability":"cha","bonuses":{"check":"","passive":""}},"per":{"value":0,"ability":"cha","bonuses":{"check":"","passive":""}},"rel":{"value":0,"ability":"int","bonuses":{"check":"","passive":""}},"slt":{"value":0,"ability":"dex","bonuses":{"check":"","passive":""}},"ste":{"value":0,"ability":"dex","bonuses":{"check":"","passive":""}},"sur":{"value":0,"ability":"wis","bonuses":{"check":"","passive":""}}},"spells":{"spell1":{"value":0,"override":null},"spell2":{"value":0,"override":null},"spell3":{"value":0,"override":null},"spell4":{"value":0,"override":null},"spell5":{"value":0,"override":null},"spell6":{"value":0,"override":null},"spell7":{"value":0,"override":null},"spell8":{"value":0,"override":null},"spell9":{"value":0,"override":null},"pact":{"value":0,"override":null}},"bonuses":{"mwak":{"attack":"","damage":""},"rwak":{"attack":"","damage":""},"msak":{"attack":"","damage":""},"rsak":{"attack":"","damage":""},"abilities":{"check":"","save":"","skill":""},"spell":{"dc":""}},"resources":{"legact":{"value":3,"max":3},"legres":{"value":0,"max":0},"lair":{"value":true,"initiative":0}}},"prototypeToken":{"flags":{},"name":"Aberrant Tyrant","displayName":20,"width":2,"height":2,"lockRotation":false,"rotation":0,"actorLink":false,"disposition":-1,"displayBars":20,"bar1":{"attribute":"attributes.hp"},"bar2":{"attribute":"attributes.ac.value"},"randomImg":false,"alpha":1,"light":{"dim":0,"bright":0,"angle":360,"color":null,"alpha":1,"animation":{"speed":5,"intensity":5,"type":null,"reverse":false},"coloration":1,"attenuation":0.5,"luminosity":0.5,"saturation":0,"contrast":0,"shadows":0,"darkness":{"min":0,"max":1}},"texture":{"src":"beneos_tokens_assets/085_aberrant_tyrant_2/top/085_aberrant_tyrant_2-idle_1_top.webm","tint":null,"scaleX":1,"scaleY":1,"offsetX":0,"offsetY":0,"rotation":0},"sight":{"angle":360,"enabled":true,"range":120,"brightness":0,"visionMode":"darkvision","color":null,"attenuation":0,"saturation":-1,"contrast":0},"detectionModes":[]},"_stats":{"systemId":"dnd5e","systemVersion":"2.1.5","coreVersion":"10.291","createdTime":1669973655892,"modifiedTime":1684699341706,"lastModifiedBy":"aiycoH7UFhTW8VJy"},"ownership":{"default":0,"aiycoH7UFhTW8VJy":3},"folder":null,"sort":0,"_id":"ocpUbC7wAvg4qMO1"}

Offensively</strong></h3><p></p><div><ul><li><p>Although the Aberrant Tyrant seems complicated due to the vast amounts of different Eye Beams, it is really quite simple to run, as you can’t really plan around the different Beams, because they are determined randomly. You can however adapt your tactics by choosing the target for each beam.</p><div><p></p></div></li><li><p>With the Tyrant’s Beams, you get a variety of Dexterity, Constitution and Wisdom saves. Depending on how Intelligent or battle-savy your Tyrant is, it might have figured out the party’s weaknesses after a few beams. This lets you start to apply some tactics - roll for the beam, than choose the most effective target.</p><div><p></p></div></li><li><p>With Enervation, Disintegration and Death Beam there are only three beams that actually deal damage (which is intended, as discussed below). Enervation is the only one, where a even a successful saving throw results in half damage. While the Tyrant’s other beam effects are undoubtedly powerful, an unlucky combination of beams against a resilient party might enable them to quickly outdamage the Tyrant. The trick is to set up the battlefield in a way that each beam can be utilized in an effective way and no beam feels like a fluke.</p><div><p></p></div></li><li><p>To expand on that with an example: The Telekinetic Beam becomes vastly more dangerous if there are terrain featurs within the Tyrant’s lair that interact with the beam. Hanging cages slamming shut when the Tyrant telekinetically moves a creature into them, pits with minor monsters in them to throw a player into or open fires to just dangle a mouthy barbarian over, slowly roasting them. The Telekinetic Beam can also lift an object up to 300 pounds, which might still include a smaller or more nimble petrified party member. Nothing like having your petrified gnome bard flung at you!</p><div><p></p></div></li><li><p>It is also really funny to use Telekinesis to move a sleeping creature that got hit by the aptly named Sleep Beam out of reach for the rest of the party, rendering them unable to wake the creature or force them to really commit to waking them up. Enjoy your nap!</p><p></p></li><li><p>The threat of Disintegration should loom large. A player petrified by the, again accurately named, Petrifying Beam becomes an object and Large or smaller objects automatically get disintegrated. You can consider a magically petrified player as a magical object to keep the Tyrant from dusting your party, but otherwise it is a neat party trick.</p><div><p></p></div></li><li><p>Be careful not to overcompensate with traps or minions for a perceived lack of damaging Beam options - the anti-magic cone is arguably the Tyrant’s greatest weapon, as most healing is magical, be it spells or potions. Safe for a few mechanics that allow to non-magical self heal, there aren’t many ways to reliably heal other characters without magic. Keep your cone focused on characters with low hit points and you will have your players praying for anything but the disintegration or death beams, so it all works out in the end.</p><div><p></p></div></li><li><p>Overcharge Null Field can be devastating trump card towards the end of an encounter, when the players have probably spent most of their low level spells and saved their higher level spell slots for the right moment. Destroying something like two fourth level spell slots for 8d8 damage and robbing the character of the opportunity to use them will absolutely sting and it can get so much worse than that. </p><div><p></p></div></li></ul><h3><strong>2. Defensively.</strong></h3><ul><li><p>Defensively the Tyrant almost completely relies on its Null Field. It has no legendary resistances or interesting defensive capabilities otherwise, except for solid saving throw proficiencies. It is paramount to get the most out of the largest cone you’ll probably ever use and keep those pesky magic users in line.</p><div><p></p></div></li><li><p>With only 180 hit points, the Tyrant is quite squishy. Being as paranoid as they are, it would not be unreasonable to take some kind of defensive measures to mitigate this weakness. Maybe a floating and rotund construct crafted in the likeness of the Tyrant, capable of taking half damage for the Tyrant and firing less powerful versions of some of the eye beams? Call it an Eye Guardian perhaps and watch the disgusted expression on your players face. Could be fun!</p></li></ul></div><div><div><ul><li><p>If you want to keep your friends, you could just let the Tyrant become slowly aware of the different kinds of danger the individual characters pose and have it act accordingly. Use your floating to stay out of reach of powerful melee characters or fling them away using Telekinesis (the utility beam, you will be so happy each time you roll it up!).</p><div><p></p></div></li><li><p>In all seriousness - quickly identify the biggest dangers for the Tyrant’s quickly dwindling hit points and prioritise dealing with them.</p><div><p></p></div></li><li><p>Try and Charm Beam the party’s cleric, maybe you can convince them to heal you.</p></li></ul><h3><strong>3. General Notes</strong></h3><div><p></p></div><ul><li><p>As always, don’t run your big boss monster on its own. It should have minions with them that harry your party, so rangers and rogues can’t just comfortably sit back and snipe. Thats just one factor, but it tends to come up a lot. If your magic users are to powerful, thats on your creatures. Keep ‘em busy fighting for their life and you won’t have to worry about them raining death upon your delicately crafted enemies. A boss’s minions should mitigate some weaknesses of the boss, so that removing them feels like an actual step towards defeating the boss, rather than them just clogging up the battlefield and makes for a multi-phase fight without getting to complicated with the set up of the fight.</p><div><p></p></div></li><li><p>Aberrant Tyrants are certifiably insane, so make sure to use the opportunity to get ham and utilize your wildest dreams of lair construction. Floating spheres of lava? Check. The whole lair dressed as a bee hive with giant bees patrolling its tunnels and the Tyrant themselves styled as a bee queen, painted back and yellow with a little crown on top? Check. You can get away with everything an unhined Aberration might dream into existence.</p><div><p></p></div></li><li><p>The Null Field is the Tyrants bread and butter. It can be tricky to get the most of it, that is why we included the nice little gotcha in form of the Realign legendary action. This can really turn a round of combat for the worse, as the players will have to work towards getting around the cone to heal or, well, use magic. Just shrugging and turning a bit to get them back into view can be really, really annoyingly powerful</p></li></ul></div></div>","public":""},"alignment":"Lawful Evil","race":"","type":{"value":"aberration","subtype":"","swarm":"","custom":""},"environment":"","cr":14,"spellLevel":0,"source":"Beneos Tokens"},"traits":{"size":"lg","di":{"value":[],"bypasses":[],"custom":""},"dr":{"value":[],"bypasses":[],"custom":""},"dv":{"value":[],"bypasses":[],"custom":""},"ci":{"value":["prone"],"custom":""},"languages":{"value":["deep","undercommon"],"custom":""}},"currency":{"pp":0,"gp":0,"ep":0,"sp":0,"cp":0},"skills":{"acr":{"value":0,"ability":"dex","bonuses":{"check":"","passive":""}},"ani":{"value":0,"ability":"wis","bonuses":{"check":"","passive":""}},"arc":{"value":0,"ability":"int","bonuses":{"check":"","passive":""}},"ath":{"value":0,"ability":"str","bonuses":{"check":"","passive":""}},"dec":{"value":0,"ability":"cha","bonuses":{"check":"","passive":""}},"his":{"value":0,"ability":"int","bonuses":{"check":"","passive":""}},"ins":{"value":0,"ability":"wis","bonuses":{"check":"","passive":""}},"itm":{"value":0,"ability":"cha","bonuses":{"check":"","passive":""}},"inv":{"value":0,"ability":"int","bonuses":{"check":"","passive":""}},"med":{"value":0,"ability":"wis","bonuses":{"check":"","passive":""}},"nat":{"value":0,"ability":"int","bonuses":{"check":"","passive":""}},"prc":{"value":2,"ability":"wis","bonuses":{"check":"","passive":""}},"prf":{"value":0,"ability":"cha","bonuses":{"check":"","passive":""}},"per":{"value":0,"ability":"cha","bonuses":{"check":"","passive":""}},"rel":{"value":0,"ability":"int","bonuses":{"check":"","passive":""}},"slt":{"value":0,"ability":"dex","bonuses":{"check":"","passive":""}},"ste":{"value":0,"ability":"dex","bonuses":{"check":"","passive":""}},"sur":{"value":0,"ability":"wis","bonuses":{"check":"","passive":""}}},"spells":{"spell1":{"value":0,"override":null},"spell2":{"value":0,"override":null},"spell3":{"value":0,"override":null},"spell4":{"value":0,"override":null},"spell5":{"value":0,"override":null},"spell6":{"value":0,"override":null},"spell7":{"value":0,"override":null},"spell8":{"value":0,"override":null},"spell9":{"value":0,"override":null},"pact":{"value":0,"override":null}},"bonuses":{"mwak":{"attack":"","damage":""},"rwak":{"attack":"","damage":""},"msak":{"attack":"","damage":""},"rsak":{"attack":"","damage":""},"abilities":{"check":"","save":"","skill":""},"spell":{"dc":""}},"resources":{"legact":{"value":3,"max":3},"legres":{"value":0,"max":0},"lair":{"value":true,"initiative":0}}},"prototypeToken":{"flags":{},"name":"Aberrant Tyrant","displayName":20,"width":2,"height":2,"lockRotation":false,"rotation":0,"actorLink":false,"disposition":-1,"displayBars":20,"bar1":{"attribute":"attributes.hp"},"bar2":{"attribute":"attributes.ac.value"},"randomImg":false,"alpha":1,"light":{"dim":0,"bright":0,"angle":360,"color":null,"alpha":1,"animation":{"speed":5,"intensity":5,"type":null,"reverse":false},"coloration":1,"attenuation":0.5,"luminosity":0.5,"saturation":0,"contrast":0,"shadows":0,"darkness":{"min":0,"max":1}},"texture":{"src":"beneos_tokens_assets/085_aberrant_tyrant_1/top/085_aberrant_tyrant_1-idle_1_top.webm","tint":null,"scaleX":1,"scaleY":1,"offsetX":0,"offsetY":0,"rotation":0},"sight":{"angle":360,"enabled":true,"range":120,"brightness":0,"visionMode":"darkvision","color":null,"attenuation":0,"saturation":-1,"contrast":0},"detectionModes":[]},"_stats":{"systemId":"dnd5e","systemVersion":"2.1.5","coreVersion":"10.291","createdTime":1669973655892,"modifiedTime":1684699341612,"lastModifiedBy":"aiycoH7UFhTW8VJy"},"ownership":{"default":0,"aiycoH7UFhTW8VJy":3},"folder":null,"sort":0,"_id":"oyj8vUFTdbUUYXnp"}
